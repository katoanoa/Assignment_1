       <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur <br>adipiscing elit.</p> 
        <h2>Interest in IT </h2>
        <p>Once I left high school, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do with my studies. I tried out architecture and engineering and although both were interesting it didn’t really feel right. I took a break from university to try and figure out what I wanted to do and work during the meanwhile. I picked up programming as a hobby and started making games on Unity and Unreal. I really enjoyed myself when I get coding and I thought, hey this might be it for me. After researching and having a look at the prospects I saw IT as a huge field that had so many things that I think are interesting and I’m looking forward to getting myself more and more familiar with it. However, I did take quite a long time and have found the time I might have had to commute to university to be very small and kind of difficult. So, I am studying online with RMIT because I see it as a more accessible option studying from the comfort of my home. The more and more I learn about it I find myself more and more enamored and sucked in by the whole field. I seek to learn more about the field of IT and figure out exactly what path I want to take in the future, and in the meanwhile increase my knowledge and technical skills that would be required to work in those fields. With so many avenues to take I can’t help but be excited for the future of my study and this field. </p>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Job Description</h4></li>
            <p>This role involves working on designing and creating UI interfaces using react. Essentially I would have to create the user interfaces for software/web applications and also maintain them. I think making website/apps is really cool and interesting and often find myself lost at how much information is already out there. I would like to one day be well versed enough in the area to make my own unique implementations rather than learn and figure out what other people have already tried and tested. It is certainly a long process but I have to start somewhere.</p> <br>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Qualifications and Skills required</h4></li>
            <p>I would have to be well versed in at least Javascript for front end, and Java for backend. This is the 2 I would start working on first. In addition to database design, utilizing Agile and scrum processes, and becoming more experienced in API development. I would also need to be able to work solo or in a team environment, thus requiring good communication skills and time management skills.</p> <br>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Current skills</h4></li>
            <p>I have only the beginnings of HTML and CSS currently. I have used Figma to design sites in the past and have experience using the Adobe suite.</p> <br>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>How to acquire skills</h4></li>
            <p>Firstly I have a few resources already that I’m following to familiarize myself with JAVA, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Alongside lectures these are what I will use whenever the information align. Although in the job description they do mention many other utilities for front and backend development, for those I would have to first familiarize myself with them and figure out what I can learn right now and what I would leave to learn later once I have already developed my skills.</p> <br>

        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4></li>
            <p>For the personality tests I have identified from my results that I am more introverted and might have problems with discipline. I will take that into consideration when reflecting and acting on interpersonal skills like having good communication with team members and making sure I manage my time properly. In regards to the learning style I can implement a few of the tips and ideas mentioned in the results if I face any struggles with certain study or work, or even try them regardless to see if they will be more efficient than the strategies that I am currently implementing.</p> <br>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4></li>
            <p>I might be a little quiet when it comes to my opinions or I may be running late on tasks due to bad time management skills. However, I would be open to unique ideas and may propose them if I manage to become more open and more adept at social skills.</p> <br>
        </ul>
       
        <ul>
            <li><h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h4></li>
            <p>I will try and push myself to be more sociable and communicate better with the team. I will use time management applications like Trello to organize my tasks and make sure I’m not lagging in them. Rather than come up with a strategy of what to do when I fall behind I will implement strategies like this to not fall behind to begin with. </p> <br>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Overview</h4></li>
            <p>My project will be a companion app for individuals who are Muslim, new to Islam, or are interested in the Islamic faith. The religion is very vast and often time plagued by misunderstandings due to lack of knowledge or pure misinformation. New Muslims can find themselves overwhelmed by how much information there is out there and often times need someone who is practicing guiding them and get them more familiar with all the practices, however not everyone can have such an individual help them and it’s hard to have someone to be there at all times. The app will be there to outline the basics that a Muslim would have to do on the day to day such as the daily prayers (which are mandatory), and other voluntary things that are a bit confusing to follow due to specific timings and other aspects that make it difficult for even me, a person who’s been practicing their whole life, to follow. I hope that this makes it easier for the everyday Muslim to track their daily tasks and make it easy for the new convert to get accustomed to the faith.</p> <br>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Motivation</h4></li>
            <p>Islam is a religion that is slowly increasing in size as the years go along. With a steady increase in Australia by almost 27% according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the 2016 Census. Even increasing by 34.6% in 2021. So not even considering the increasing population in Australia this doesn’t even include the number overseas. With most Islamcentric apps focusing on recitation of the Quran(the Islamic holy book) and muslims who already have an understanding of what they need to do, not many focus on people who are completely in the dark. I think there has to be a better beginner friendly focused application that can also be created to cater to the individual person as the Muslim population is vast and cultural practices differ around the world, there needs to be a baseline that is based on only faith that can be used by users globally.</p> <br>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Description</h4></li>
            <p>Essentially I hope to focus on a few things that can be separated into 3 parts. A tracker feature to help individuals keep track of mandatory tasks that will be based on local time and date. With a primary focus on daily prayers as a guaranteed baseline. With an alarm to let an individual know when exactly it time for prayer. In addition, it will have an option to include voluntary practices that can differ on time of day and time of year. These things have often specific timings which can become overwhelming when you have done nothing of it and are attempting it all for the first time. As a new convert you might start off having only the daily prayers listed as a reminder and with time as you come to familiarize yourself with the schedule you can start to add more things. Essentially having an experience that caters to your own religious journey. And in this regard even Muslims who have been practicing for a long time can just add increasingly to match what their current schedule.<br><br>
                In addition to this a map feature that will outline local mosques/prayer areas and local Islamic community centers that individuals can go to pray or look to participate in community events and activities. In addition to this the profile of local imams that they can seek to contact on queries or general help that they might need. It also is hard to find Halal food (food that is permissible a Muslim to eat) so listing on map for more details such as local halal certified restaurants, markets, and butchers. As this is something someone new to Islam will have to quickly get used to and it might be a bit confusing trying to figure out where you can comfortably buy food from because as someone who has been Muslim all my life that is certainly something difficult for even us to do sometimes. <br><br>
                And finally, a dua (supplication) feature detailing different prayers that you can recite daily that will be filtered according to the need and context of the situation. There are many supplications that an individual can recite during the day (which are not mandatory) but they are so extensive that there is one for almost any specific thing that you might encounter. A potential search bar with keywords that might be able to specifically select a supplication meant for your current scenario with English and Arabic translations. Alongside with frequently asked questions about the Islamic faith that would be useful to people interested in Islam and new converts. And depending on how much we have to work with it can become as detailed as possible. Adding more and more frequently asked questions that even the everyday Muslim might be confused by.<br>

            <li><h4>Tools and Technologies</h4></li>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> To organize the text in most web applications (language commonly used in web development)</li>
                <li><strong>CSS</strong> used with HTML to style the application/web page</li>
                <li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The educational application used by RMIT to access course content, upload work and liaison with lecturers/tutors</li>
                <li><strong>SQL:</strong> To communicate with databases to sort and organize and update data</li>
                <li><strong>Github:</strong> To maintain backups on the application and track software from start of project until the end</li>
                <li><strong>Trello:</strong> To organize tasks and handling time management </li>
                <li><strong>Discord/Microsoft Teams:</strong> To communicate between team members</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Skills Required</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>Time management</li>
                    <li>Communication Skills</li>
                    <li>Database Management</li>
                    <li>Database Hosting</li>
                    <li>Agile</li>
                    <li>SCRUM</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>Figma</li>
<p> I believe it is very feasible to gain skills in all these areas. As i have already started learning and acquiring a few of these if proper work is put in and i dont slack off i believe i will be able to excel in all these areas in time.</p>
                </ul>
            
        </ul>
       
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Outcome</h4></li>
            <p>This will result in new muslims and enthusiasts having an easy pathway into the religon of Islam. With the help of other community members they can utilise this application so that the tall and steep hurdle of entering and learning to practice this 1400 year old religon will be a bit easier. With more hands I would aim to add more languages as Islam is a very international religon, and practicers of this faith vary in nationality and culture, and as such since this is an application that aims to cater to muslim and people who are interested in Islam it should eventually be in multiple languages.</p> <br>
